            <h2>How to Develop Players</h2>
            <p class="Develop">Trending players are versions of players who have put in excellent performances on a
                particular week and
                have had their stats boosted to reflect that performance. This type of player is perfect for immediate
                inclusion on your team sheet, but can't be developed any further.</p>
            <p class="Develop">Standard, Featured and Legendary players can all be trained to boost their stats and
                fine-tune their
                abilities to fit your game plan. They may not start with impressive stats like their Trending
                counterparts, but given enough time to develop they may eventually become a better fit for your team!
            </p>
            <p class="Develop">Therefore, develop your players via Training; Fine-tune them to better suit your game
                plan and guide
                your team to glory!
            </p>
            <p class="Develop">
                Moreover, additional Training Programs will be introduced in the future to provide further development
                options for your players.
