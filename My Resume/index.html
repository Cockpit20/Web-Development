        <!-- <p><strong>Center Back,</strong><em> Manchester United </em><span class="right">08/2019 – present</span>
        <div class="right">Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England</div>
        </p>
        <p>In July 2019, Manchester United made a £70 million bid for Maguire, a year after the club backed down from a
            deal because the same fee was considered too high. They made an improved bid, believed to be £80 million,
            which was accepted by Leicester on 2 August. The fee surpassed the £75 million Liverpool paid for Virgil van
            Dijk
            in January 2018, making Maguire the world's most expensive defender. The transfer was completed on 5 August,
            with Maguire signing a six-year contract with the option of a further year. He made his United debut in
            their
            opening match of the Premier League season, a 4–0 home victory over Chelsea on 11 August, and received the
            Man of the Match award.</p>
        <p><strong>Center Back,</strong><em> Leicester City </em><span class="right">06/2017 – 04/2018 </span>
        <div class="right">Leicester in the East Midlands, England</div>
        </p>
        <p>On 15 June 2017, Maguire signed for Premier League club Leicester City on a five-year contract for an initial
            £12
            million fee, potentially rising to £17 million with add-ons. He made his debut on 11 August as the season
            began
            with a 4–3 loss at Arsenal, and eight days later he scored his first goal for the Foxes, heading in Riyad
            Mahrez's
            corner to conclude a 2–0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion at the King Power Stadium. He played in every
            minute
            of the 2017–18 season and was awarded player of the season, as well as players' player of the season at the
            club's
            end-of-season awards.

        <p><strong>Center Back,</strong><em> Hull City </em><span class="right">04/2014 – 04/2016 </span>
        <div class="right">Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire </div>
        </p>
        <p>On 29 July 2014, Maguire joined Hull City in a deal worth £2.5 million, signing a three-year contract. He
            made his
            debut for the Tigers on 21 August in the UEFA Europa League play-off round first leg away to Lokeren of
            Belgium,
            a 1–0 defeat. He did not make his Premier League debut until 20 December, when he replaced the injured
            Curtis
            Davies for the final 13 minutes of a home loss by the same score against Swansea City.

        <div class="right">Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England </div>
        </p>
        <p>After coming through the youth system at Sheffield United, and with the team struggling against relegation,
            Maguire was promoted to the first-team squad, making his debut after coming on as a half-time substitute and
            winning the man of the match award in a home match against Cardiff City in April 2011.
